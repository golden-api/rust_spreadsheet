# rust_spreadsheet
Implementing spreadsheet program on rust for better memory management

# **TODO** #
-- see for memory saving as it is taking too much memory --
-- pinning the col and row name to their position while scrolling also --
-- making the scroll_to tab at right corner --
-- formula bar should behave as command bar (when no cell is selected using Esc key) --
-- Select multiple cells by dragging upto certainn extent atleast --
-- cut copy paste and save should be supported along with conversion to csv ig--
-- looks could be better themes support maybe , with better ui --
